## Abstract

In the framework of **quantum sensing** and **spectroscopy with quantum light**, this undergraduate project proposes a new approach to Raman spectroscopy based on the **interference of entangled photon pairs**.  
Inspired by *Quantum Femtosecond Raman Spectroscopy* (QFRS), it develops a variant that uses **quantum-induced coherence**, aiming to **reduce noise sensitivity** in measurements.  

Analytical models previously established in the literature are reviewed, and new theoretical models are developed as the foundation for future numerical simulations.  
This work contributes to the consolidation of **advanced quantum-light spectroscopy schemes**, with potential applications in **quantum LiDAR** and **quantum metrology**.  

**Keywords:** Quantum sensing, quantum light spectroscopy, quantum LiDAR, quantum metrology.

## Introduction

Quantum metrology has demonstrated that it is possible to surpass classical precision limits by exploiting quantum resources such as **entanglement** and **superposition**. These principles have led to the development of advanced measurement techniques that significantly improve sensitivity and resolution in various experimental contexts, such as **LiDAR** (Light Imaging Detection and Ranging) {% cite GALLEGOTORROME2024100497 %} and **spectroscopy** {% cite roadmap_Mukamel_2020 %}.  

Among the most recent proposals are the **Quantum Induced Coherence LiDAR (QuIC LiDAR)** protocol {% cite QuIC-LiDAR %}, which employs quantum interference to enhance remote detection, and **Quantum Femtosecond Raman Spectroscopy (QFRS)** {% cite Entangled_Raman-Spectroscopy %}, which leverages entangled photons to extract spectral information with superior sensitivity.  
These two protocols constitute the conceptual foundation of this project.

QuIC LiDAR employs photon pairs generated by **spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC)** {% cite Burnham1970 %}. In each pair, one photon (signal) interacts with the sample, while the other (idler) is detected without being exposed to the environment. The scheme relies on generating photon pairs along two indistinguishable paths.  
The indistinguishability of the detected photon’s origin leads to an interference pattern of type **SU(1,1)** {% cite PadillaCamargo2023 %}. This architecture allows reconstructing the spatial profile or distance of an object by measuring only the idler beam, composed of photons in a **superposition state** of both generation alternatives — thus **evading environmental noise** that would affect the signal beam. This phenomenon, known as **induced coherence** {% cite InducedCoherenceZWM %}, has been demonstrated to overcome limitations inherent to classical detection systems.

The *Femtosecond Adaptive Spectroscopic Technique via Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering* (**FAST CARS**) {% cite fastcars_Pestov2007-ob %} is a classical nonlinear spectroscopic technique that uses **ultrashort broadband pulses** to coherently excite multiple vibrational modes of a sample, followed by a **narrowband probe pulse** with a controlled time delay. The resulting **anti-Stokes emission** carries the molecular vibrational information specific to the sample {% cite CLASCARS_ELDIASTY20111 %}. This technique was designed to enhance the resonant signal and suppress the non-resonant background; for instance, it enables the **real-time identification of bacterial spores** such as anthrax {% cite spores_Scully2002-ut %}.  
In atmospheric LiDAR applications, spontaneous anti-Stokes scattering is used to characterize aerosols, particles, and gas composition {% cite Gimmestad2023 %}.  
However, FAST CARS faces a **fundamental limitation**: the **trade-off between temporal and spectral resolution**, imposed by the uncertainty relation for classical pulses.

The **QFRS technique** was specifically developed to overcome this limitation. It employs **entangled photon pairs** generated through SPDC, where the **signal photon** probes the vibrational coherences of the sample and the **idler photon** serves as a **temporal reference**. Molecular species identification is achieved through **coincidence detection**, **spectral selection**, and **heterodyne detection** applied to the signal photon {% cite heterodinaCollett %}.  
Time- and frequency-resolved analysis of the detected signals allows retrieving the **unique vibrational signatures** of each molecule.  
By using entangled photons, QFRS achieves **superior resolution**, unbounded by the classical pulse-duration vs. bandwidth compromise, and it is firmly grounded in the framework of **nonlinear and quantum optics** {% cite theory_RevModPhys.88.045008 %}.

This project proposes a **new variant of Raman spectroscopy** based on quantum light, inspired by QFRS {% cite Entangled_Raman-Spectroscopy %} but structured according to the **interferometric architecture of QuIC LiDAR** {% cite QuIC-LiDAR %}.  
The proposal consists of using **entangled photon pairs** in an **SU(1,1)-type interferometer**, exploiting the phenomenon of **quantum-induced coherence** {% cite InducedCoherenceZWM %}.  
Such an architecture would make it possible to **avoid heterodyne detection** and perform measurements **solely on the idler photons**, i.e., those that do not interact directly with the sample — significantly reducing environmental noise exposure.  
The goal is to develop a **theoretical model** for **quantum Raman spectroscopy** that combines **high temporal and spectral resolution**, unbounded by classical trade-offs, and benefits from the **noise resilience** offered by induced coherence.

## Theoretical Framework (Summary)

The general state for a superposition of \( k \) entangled-photon generation paths is given by:

$$|\Phi\rangle = \sum_k \int d\omega_s \, d\omega_i \, \Phi_k(\omega_s, \omega_i) \, a^\dagger_{\omega_s,k} a^\dagger_{\omega_i,k} |0\rangle, $$

where \( \Phi_k(\omega_s, \omega_i) \) is the **joint spectral amplitude** defining time–frequency correlations between the signal and idler photons.  

The detection of coincident photons is described by:

$$ S(\omega_s, \omega_i) = \langle \Phi | E_s^\dagger(\omega_s) E_i^\dagger(\omega_i) E_i(\omega_i) E_s(\omega_s) | \Phi \rangle. $$

In an **SU(1,1) interferometer** with two sources (\(k = 2\)), interference terms appear that encode **induced coherence** and thus molecular information.

**Is it possible to improve coherent Raman spectroscopy with quantum light using an interference scheme based on entangled-photon-pair states?**

## General Objective

Analyze theoretical models to quantify the potential enhancement of **quantum-light-based Raman spectroscopy** using **interferometric schemes** of entangled photon pairs, and compare their performance to traditional configurations through **numerical simulations**.

## Specific Objectives

1. Theoretically characterize the QFRS scheme focused on vibrational coherences through model development and simulation.  
2. Design and analyze an interferometric Raman protocol based on induced coherence in SU(1,1) configurations.  
3. Compare spectral sensitivity, noise suppression, and phase information retrieval between the proposed scheme and QFRS.

## Methodology (in bullets)

The project is divided into two main phases:  

**Phase A1 — Characterization of QFRS:**  
Development of a theoretical QFRS model emphasizing light–matter coupling, coincidence signal simulation, and resolution analysis.  

**Phase A2 — Design of an interferometric Raman protocol:**  
Modeling of quantum interference in an SU(1,1) configuration with two SPDC sources, numerical simulation of induced-coherence-based signals, and comparison with QFRS in terms of performance and robustness.

## Expected Results

- Validation of the QFRS model using a representative molecular system (e.g., methane).  
- Development of an **SU(1,1) interferometric extension** capable of maintaining vibrational coherence without heterodyne detection.  
- Evaluation of temporal and spectral resolution improvements and noise immunity.

## Budget (Summary)
