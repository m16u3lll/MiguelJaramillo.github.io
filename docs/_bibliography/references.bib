   abstract = {Around the globe several observatories are seeking the first direct detection of gravitational waves (GWs). These waves are predicted by Einstein's general theory of relativity and are generated, for example, by black-hole binary systems. Present GW detectors are Michelson-type kilometre-scale laser interferometers measuring the distance changes between mirrors suspended in vacuum. The sensitivity of these detectors at frequencies above several hundred hertz is limited by the vacuum (zero-point) fluctuations of the electromagnetic field. A quantum technology - the injection of squeezed light - offers a solution to this problem. Here we demonstrate the squeezed-light enhancement of GEO 600, which will be the GW observatory operated by the LIGO Scientific Collaboration in its search for GWs for the next 3-4 years. GEO 600 now operates with its best ever sensitivity, which proves the usefulness of quantum entanglement and the qualification of squeezed light as a key technology for future GW astronomy.},

   abstract = {Electric-field noise near surfaces is a common problem in diverse areas of physics and a limiting factor for many precision measurements. There are multiple mechanisms by which such noise is generated, many of which are poorly understood. Laser-cooled, trapped ions provide one of the most sensitive systems to probe electric-field noise at MHz frequencies and over a distance range 30-3000 μm from a surface. Over recent years numerous experiments have reported spectral densities of electric-field noise inferred from ion heating-rate measurements and several different theoretical explanations for the observed noise characteristics have been proposed. This paper provides an extensive summary and critical review of electric-field noise measurements in ion traps and compares these experimental findings with known and conjectured mechanisms for the origin of this noise. This reveals that the presence of multiple noise sources, as well as the different scalings added by geometrical considerations, complicates the interpretation of these results. It is thus the purpose of this review to assess which conclusions can be reasonably drawn from the existing data, and which important questions are still open. In so doing it provides a framework for future investigations of surface-noise processes.},

   abstract = {Decoherence, resulting from unwanted interaction between a qubit and its environment, poses a serious challenge towards the development of quantum technologies. Recently, researchers have started analysing how real-time Hamiltonian learning approaches, based on estimating the qubit state faster than the environmental fluctuations, can be used to counteract decoherence. In this work, we investigate how the back-action of the quantum measurements used in the learning process can be harnessed to extend qubit coherence. We propose an adaptive protocol that, by learning the qubit environment, narrows down the distribution of possible environment states. While the outcomes of quantum measurements are random, we show that real-time adaptation of measurement settings (based on previous outcomes) allows a deterministic decrease of the width of the bath distribution, and hence an increase of the qubit coherence. We numerically simulate the performance of the protocol for the electronic spin of a nitrogen-vacancy centre in diamond subject to a dilute bath of 13C nuclear spin, finding a considerable improvement over the performance of non-adaptive strategies.},

Here, we demonstrate that crystals of trapped atomic ions11,12 behave as nanoscale mechanical oscillators and may form the core of exquisitely sensitive force and displacement detectors.

Our technique is based on the excitation of tunable normal motional modes in an ion trap and detection through phase-coherent Doppler velocimetry, and should ultimately allow force detection with a sensitivity better than 1 yN Hz -1/2 (ref. 16).

abstract = {Quantum sensing, built upon fundamental quantum phenomena like entanglement and squeezing, is revolutionizing precision and sensitivity across diverse domains, including quantum metrology and imaging. Its impact is now stretching into radar and LiDAR applications, giving rise to the concept of quantum radar. Unlike traditional radar systems relying on classical electromagnetic, quantum radar harnesses the potential of the quantum properties of photon states like entanglement and quantum superposition to transcend established boundaries in sensitivity and accuracy. This comprehensive review embarks on an exploration of quantum radar and quantum LiDAR, guided by two primary objectives: enhancing sensitivity through quantum resources and refining accuracy in target detection and range estimation through quantum techniques. We initiate our exploration with a thorough analysis of the fundamental principles of quantum radar, which includes an evaluation of quantum illumination protocols, receiver designs, and their associated methodologies. This investigation spans across both microwave and optical domains, providing us with insights into various experimental demonstrations and the existing technological limitations. Additionally, we review the applications of quantum radar protocols for enhanced accuracy in target range determination and estimation. This section of our review involves a comprehensive analysis of quantum illumination, quantum interferometry radar, and other quantum radar protocols, providing insights into their contributions to the field. This review offers valuable insights into the current state of quantum radar, providing a deep understanding of key concepts, experiments, and the evolving landscape of this dynamic and promising field.}

    abstract = "{Photons have been a flagship system for studying quantum mechanics, advancing quantum information science, and developing quantum technologies. Quantum entanglement, teleportation, quantum key distribution, and early quantum computing demonstrations were pioneered in this technology because photons represent a naturally mobile and low-noise system with quantum-limited detection readily available. The quantum states of individual photons can be manipulated with very high precision using interferometry, an experimental staple that has been under continuous development since the 19th century. The complexity of photonic quantum computing devices and protocol realizations has raced ahead as both underlying technologies and theoretical schemes have continued to develop. Today, photonic quantum computing represents an exciting path to medium- and large-scale processing. It promises to put aside its reputation for requiring excessive resource overheads due to inefficient two-qubit gates. Instead, the ability to generate large numbers of photons—and the development of integrated platforms, improved sources and detectors, novel noise-tolerant theoretical approaches, and more—have solidified it as a leading contender for both quantum information processing and quantum networking. Our concise review provides a flyover of some key aspects of the field, with a focus on experiment. Apart from being a short and accessible introduction, its many references to in-depth articles and longer specialist reviews serve as a launching point for deeper study of the field.}",

    abstract = { Several quantities of interest in quantum information, including entanglement and purity, are nonlinear functions of the density matrix and cannot, even in principle, correspond to proper quantum observables. Any method aimed to determine the value of these quantities should resort to indirect measurements and thus corresponds to a parameter estimation problem whose solution, i.e. the determination of the most precise estimator, unavoidably involves an optimization procedure. We review local quantum estimation theory and present explicit formulas for the symmetric logarithmic derivative and the quantum Fisher information of relevant families of quantum states. Estimability of a parameter is defined in terms of the quantum signal-to-noise ratio and the number of measurements needed to achieve a given relative error. The connections between the optmization procedure and the geometry of quantum statistical models are discussed. Our analysis allows to quantify quantum noise in the measurements of non observable quantities and provides a tools for the characterization of signals and devices in quantum technology. }

Each signal sent out is entangled with an ancilla, which is retained. Detection takes place via an entangling measurement on the returning signal together with the ancilla. This paper shows that for photodetection, quantum illumination with m bits of entanglement can in principle increase the effective signal-to-noise ratio by a factor of 2m, an exponential improvement over unentangled illumination. The enhancement persists even when noise and loss are so great that no entanglement survives at the detector.}}

Current studies focus on the two-photon absorption, whereas the Raman spectroscopy with quantum entanglement still remains elusive, with outstanding issues of temporal and spectral resolutions. Here we study the new capabilities provided by entangled photons in coherent Raman spectroscopy. An ultrafast frequency-resolved Raman spectroscopy with entangled photons is developed for condensed-phase molecules, to probe the electronic and vibrational coherences. Using quantum correlation between the photons, the signal shows the capability of both temporal and spectral resolutions not accessible by either classical pulses or the fields without entanglement. We develop a microscopic theory for this Raman spectroscopy, revealing the electronic coherence dynamics even at timescale of 50fs. This suggests new paradigms of optical signals and spectroscopy, with potential to push detection below standard quantum limit.},

In this paper, we revisit the theory of QOCT and extend the theoretical model so as to include photon pairs with arbitrary spectral correlations. We present experimental results that complement the theory and explain the physical underpinnings appearing in the interference pattern. In our experiment, we utilize a pump for the SPDC process ranging from continuous wave to pulsed in the femtosecond regime, and show that cross-correlation interference effects appearing for each pair of layers may be directly suppressed for a sufficiently large pump bandwidth.

abstract = {Experiments show the performance of quantum holography using undetected photons. Holography exploits the interference of a light field reflected/transmitted from an object with a reference beam to obtain a reconstruction of the spatial shape of the object. Classical holography techniques have been very successful in diverse areas such as microscopy, manufacturing technology, and basic science. However, detection constraints for wavelengths outside the visible range restrict the applications for imaging and sensing in general. For overcoming these detection limitations, we implement phase-shifting holography with nonclassical states of light, where we exploit quantum interference between two-photon probability amplitudes in a nonlinear interferometer. We demonstrate that it allows retrieving the spatial shape (amplitude and phase) of the photons transmitted/reflected from the object and thus obtaining an image of the object despite those photons are never detected. Moreover, there is no need to use a well-characterized reference beam, since the two-photon scheme already makes use of one of the photons as reference for holography.}}

The usual QOCT scheme uses photon pairs characterised by a joint-spectral amplitude with strict spectral anti-correlations. It has been shown that, in contrast with its classical counterpart, QOCT provides resolution enhancement and dispersion cancellation. In this paper, we revisit the theory of QOCT and extend the theoretical model so as to include photon pairs with arbitrary spectral correlations. We present experimental results that complement the theory and explain the physical underpinnings appearing in the interference pattern. In our experiment, we utilize a pump for the SPDC process ranging from continuous wave to pulsed in the femtosecond regime, and show that cross-correlation interference effects appearing for each pair of layers may be directly suppressed for a sufficiently large pump bandwidth. Our results provide insights and strategies that could guide practical implementations of QOCT.},

               analyzed by time-consuming microscopic, chemical, and biological

               detectors of such contaminants is based on e.g., resonance
               fluorescence. The present approach derives from recent
               experiments in which atoms and molecules are prepared by one (or
               more) coherent laser(s) and probed by another set of lasers.
               However, generating and using maximally coherent oscillation in
               macromolecules having an enormous number of degrees of freedom
               is challenging. In particular, the short dephasing times and
               rapid internal conversion rates are major obstacles. However,
               adiabatic fast passage techniques and the ability to generate
               combs of phase-coherent femtosecond pulses provide tools for the
               generation and utilization of maximal quantum coherence in large

abstract = {In this review the basis, recent developments and applications of coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) in the fields of spectroscopy and microscopy are dialed with. The nonlinear susceptibility of the investigated molecule induced by pump and Stokes laser beams employed in the CARS technique is discussed. The relation between the nonlinear susceptibility, the different CARS laser intensities and the phase matching condition between them is also presented. The structure of CARS spectrum is analyzed as a function of the physical characteristics of the different employed lasers. This includes laser half widths, interference effects, cross-coherence and saturation of the resultant CARS signal by stimulated Raman scatter process (SRS). The different broadening mechanisms for CARS spectral line such as pressure and Doppler broadening are demonstrated. The recent progress in CARS for the in situ reaction flame diagnosis due to its suitability for detection of vibrational–rotational excited gas molecules present in the electronic ground state is discussed. CARS diagnosis for liquid- and solid-phases including the progress in polymeric materials is considered. The applications of CARS microscopy are reviewed in the view of its recent advances to study chemical and biological systems.}

abstract = {Conventional spectroscopy uses classical light to detect matter properties through the variation of its response with frequencies or time delays. Quantum light opens up new avenues for spectroscopy by utilizing parameters of the quantum state of light as novel control knobs and through the variation of photon statistics by coupling to matter. This Roadmap article focuses on using quantum light as a powerful sensing and spectroscopic tool to reveal novel information about complex molecules that is not accessible by classical light. It aims at bridging the quantum optics and spectroscopy communities which normally have opposite goals: manipulating complex light states with simple matter e.g. qubits versus studying complex molecules with simple classical light, respectively. Articles cover advances in the generation and manipulation of state-of-the-art quantum light sources along with applications to sensing, spectroscopy, imaging and interferometry.}

Instantaneous coherent broadband excitation of several characteristic molecular vibrations and the subsequent probing of these vibrations by an optimally shaped time-delayed narrowband laser pulse help to suppress the nonresonant background and to retrieve the species-specific signal. We used this technique for coherent Raman spectroscopy of sodium dipicolinate powder, which is similar to calcium dipicolinate (a marker molecule for bacterial endospores, such as Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus anthracis), and we demonstrated a rapid and highly specific detection scheme that works even in the presence of multiple scattering.}}
