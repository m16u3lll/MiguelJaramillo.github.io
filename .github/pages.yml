# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "main" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
      - name: Run a one-line script
        run: echo Hello, world!

      # Runs a set of commands using the runners shell
      - name: Run a multi-line script
        run: |
          echo Add other actions to build,
          echo test, and deploy your project.

# This replaces your existing "actions/jekyll-build-pages" step

- name: Setup Ruby
  # Use an action to set up the Ruby environment
  uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1
  with:
    ruby-version: '3.1' # Use the version compatible with jekyll-scholar

- name: Install dependencies
  # This step installs the required gems, including jekyll-scholar
  run: |
    gem install bundler
    bundle config path vendor/bundle
    bundle install --jobs 4 --retry 3

- name: Build Jekyll site
  # This runs the build command directly, using the installed gems
  run: bundle exec jekyll build --future --destination ./_site
  # The '--destination ./_site' flag matches the output of your original action

- name: Upload site artifacts
  # Use this action to save the built site
  uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3

    path: ./_site
